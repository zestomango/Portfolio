			    <h4>
                    are the unique playable characters that players control during a match. Each champion has a distinct set of abilities, strengths, and weaknesses that define their playstyle and role in the game. As of now, there are over 160 champions, each with their own lore, visual design, and mechanics.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Champions fall into different roles—such as Top Laner, Mid Laner, Jungler, ADC (Attack Damage Carry), and Support—each contributing to a team’s strategy in different ways. Some are great at dealing damage, others at protecting allies or disrupting enemies.

			    <h4>
                    are cosmetic changes for champions that alter their appearance, animations, visual effects, sound effects, and sometimes voice lines. While skins do not provide any gameplay advantage, they allow players to customize their favorite champions with different looks and themes.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Skins range from subtle visual tweaks to complete thematic overhauls, placing champions in alternate universes or fantasy settings. For example, a champion might be reimagined as a futuristic warrior, a mythical creature, or even part of a fun theme like Pool Party or Star Guardian

                    define a player’s typical position on the map and their responsibilities within a team. Each of the five roles corresponds to a specific lane or area of the map and generally aligns with certain champion types and playstyles.

                <h4>

                <h4>
                    are in-game purchases that enhance a champion’s stats and abilities during a match. Players buy items with gold earned from farming minions, killing champions, taking objectives, or assisting teammates. Items are a key part of strategy, allowing players to customize their build depending on the situation.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Items in League of Legends are crucial to a champion's power and playstyle. Choosing the right items and adapting your build can be the difference between winning and losing. Effective itemization requires knowledge of both your champion and your opponents.
